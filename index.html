JavaScript is the programming language that adds interactivity and custom behaviors to our sites. It
is a client-side scripting language, which means it runs on the user’s machine and not on the server,
as other web programming languages such as PHP and Ruby do. That means JavaScript (and the way
we use it) is reliant on the browser’s capabilities and settings. It may not even be available at all,
either because the user has chosen to turn it off or because the device doesn’t support it, which good
developers keep in mind and Plan for. JavaScript is also what is known as a dynamic and loosely
typed programming language. </td>
